This widget adds a SubToMe button to your blog and allows people to subscribe to your content in one click.

== Description ==

This widget adds a [SubToMe](http://www.subtome.com/) button to your Wordpress blog. This button allows your readers to follow your blog using their **favorite** applications.

If the user clicks the button, then, it will load an external iframe with Javascript. The iframe will show the user the list of their favorite subscription tools. Once they pick one, they're redirect to it with your blog information.

The user information is stored in the browser, but is only accessible on the domain `subtome.com`, which is why we hae to load the iframe.

No data is ever "leaked". The whole [SubToMe code](https://github.com/superfeedr/subtome) is open source. Feel free to check it out by yourself.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
2. Add the widget to your layout from the 'Widget' submenu in WordPress
